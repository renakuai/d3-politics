# politics
A collection of projects and data visualizations about American politics and policies.

`gun views` - Displays dollars spent of gun rights and gun views lobbyist groups and dollars received from such groups by individual Congressmen from 1998 - 2022. (<a href="https://gun-views.netlify.app/">View live</a>)

`d3-presidential-debt` - Visualizing debt by president. A project that uses D3's force simulation physics and React's rendering to create a bubble chart that represents debt created by each US President.

I try to use D3 for calculations only and React for rendering; however, it was quite challenging to do for this project due having to figure out how to copy states into the force simulation and have React map through the copied nodes. 

I also utilized ResizeObserver for this project to help make the SVGs responsive.
